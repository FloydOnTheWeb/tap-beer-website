This was a defining moment in BrewDog prehistory, and that beer was the first incarnation of the ubiquitous Paradox. Aged in a variety of casks over the years, Paradox is dark, decadent and encapsulating. Can be enjoyed fresh; phenomenal when aged.","image":"006.png","abv":10,"ibu":55,"target_fg":1014,"target_og":1090,"ebc":300,"srm":152,"ph":4.4,"attenuation_level":84.4,"volume":{"value":20,"unit":"litres"},"boil_volume":{"value":25,"unit":"litres"},"method":{"mash_temp":[{"temp":{"value":65,"unit":"celsius"},"duration":90}],"fermentation":{"temp":{"value":21,"unit":"celsius"}},"twist":"Try ageing on oak chips, infusing with rum raisins, or vanilla pods"},"ingredients":{"malt":[{"name":"Extra Pale","amount":{"value":4.5,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Caramalt","amount":{"value":0.55,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Munich","amount":{"value":0.33,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Flaked Oats","amount":{"value":1.35,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Dark Crystal","amount":{"value":0.55,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Carafa Special Malt Type 1","amount":{"value":0.18,"unit":"kilograms"}},{"name":"Carafa Special Malt Type 3","amount":{"value":0.33,"unit":"kilograms"}}],"hops":[{"name":"Columbus","amount":{"value":75,"unit":"grams"},"add":"start","attribute":"bitter"},{"name":"Columbus","amount":{"value":25,"unit":"grams"},"add":"middle","attribute":"flavour"},{"name":"Saaz","amount":{"value":25,"unit":"grams"},"add":"end","attribute":"flavour"},{"name":"First Gold","amount":{"value":25,"unit":"grams"},"add":"end","attribute":"flavour"}],"yeast":"Wyeast 1272 - American Ale II™"},"food_pairing":["Ancho chilli beef taco","Chocolate gateaux","Rum poached pears with dark chocolate sauce"],"brewers_tips":"The beauty of this beer is in how brilliantly it lends itself to infusing or ageing.
